/*
ARPU vs ARPPU: How do these metrics change month by month? What share 
of users make purchases?

Below we calculate the monthly ARPU and ARPPU values, the average monthly 
order value, and the share of paying users among all users registered to date.

We can see that ARPU, ARPPU, the share of paying users and the average order value 
are declining. Attention should be paid to the issue of user retention â€” 
the current data suggest that retaining users has not been very successful so far. 
The drop in the average order value, even with active user acquisition, 
indicates a need to stimulate users to make their first purchase. This can be 
achieved through initiatives such as first-order discounts, free delivery guarantees, 
or similar incentives that encourage users to explore the product range and take 
advantage of the welcome offer.
